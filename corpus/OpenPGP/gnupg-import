# mark all keys with ultimate ownertrust.  This is a silly hack, but
# it's due to the fact that this corpus hasn't really decided whether
# the GnuPG homedir is supposed to represent one particular user's
# config (in which case we should just import one secret key, mark it
# with ultimate ownertrust and have it sign the others) or just
# pragmatically handle all the secret keys in a single homedir.  For
# now, we're opting for the latter.
